<p class="p1">According to the American Community Survey, a demographics survey program conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, the majority of New Yorkers relied on public transit to go to work in 2019.</p>

<p class="p2">The American Community Survey sectioned the findings into eight categories, after asking about 3.9 million working New Yorkers about their means of going to their jobs before the pandemic, which drastically changed these numbers as New Yorkers went into quarantine in March 2020.</p>

<p class="p3">Below are the eight categories. They are set in order from the biggest group to the smallest.</p>

<div class="content-container-a">
 <section>
  <img alt="Public Transit" src="icons/bus.png">
   <p><b><u>57.07% used public transit.</u></b> Out of the 3.9 million surveyed New Yorkers, over 2.2 million said they relied on the city’s public transit system. New York City’s subway-train and bus system, run by the MTA, is one of the world’s largest and most intricate.</p>

 <section>
  <img alt="Drove alone" src="icons/driving.png">
   <p><b><u>22.25% drove alone.</u></b> Less than half of those who used the city’s public transportation, roughly 880,000 New Yorkers, said they drove to work. This usually includes people coming into Manhattan from the farther areas of other boroughs.</p>
 </section>

 <section>
  <img alt="Walked" src="icons/walking.png">
   <p><b><u>9.98% walked.</u></b> This group, the third largest, stands out as the only group that doesn’t rely on any means of transportation other than their bodies. A surprising number of about a third of a million of New Yorkers (397,000) said they walked to work.</p>

<div class="content-container-b">
 <section>
  <img alt="Carpooled" src="icons/carpool.png">
   <p><b><u>4.46% carpooled.</u></b> Some 177,000 of New Yorkers said they carpooled to work. This group is both climate- and pocket-friendly —but not as much as the group that preceded it.</p>
 </section>

 <section>
  <img alt="Worked at home" src="icons/work-from-home.png">
   <p><b><u>4.31% worked from home.</u></b> About 170,000 New Yorkers said they didn’t commute because they worked from home. This number preceded the times of the pandemic, which made it that all workers —excluding essential ones— had to work from home.</p>
 </section>

 <section>
  <img alt="Bicycle" src="icons/bicycle.png">
   <p><b><u>1.26% rode a bicycle.</u></b> Over 50,000 New Yorkers said they rode a bicycle to work. This number remains small possibly due to the high rates of bicycle accidents in New York City. It is also unclear how many people of this group are delivery workers, who work while riding the bicycle.</p>
 </section>
</div>


<div class="content-container-c">
 <section>
  <img alt="Other" src="icons/asterisk.png">
   <p><b><u>0.58% used other means.</u></b> About 23,000 New Yorkers opted for “other” when answering the survey’s question about commuting. The Census Bureau didn’t specify what this category might include.</p>
 </section>

 <section>
  <img alt="Motorcycle" src="icons/motorcycle.png">
   <p><b><u>0.08% rode a motorcycle.</u></b> This group is the smallest of all groups —but also the coolest— with only 3,235 New Yorkers who said they rode a motorcycle to work.</p>
 </section>
</div>

<p class="p4">The 2019 American Community Survey also reported that the average commute to work lasted for 42 minutes. However, many New Yorkers typically take over an hour to be at their jobs.</p>
